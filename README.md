# Music Genre Classification

This is a machine learning short project for UPC-240AR022.
We try to classify songs by genres using several machine learning technics.
Please check our [report](https://github.com/smaillot/music-genre-classification/blob/master/short_project_machine_learning.pdf) if you want more details.<br/>
Running our features extraction program can take a while on a regular desktop. However you can have some preview of the resulting vectors in both PCA and LDA coordinates on this [notebook](https://github.com/smaillot/music-genre-classification/blob/master/data-visualization-and-knn-classification/data-visualization-and-knn-classification.ipynb)
